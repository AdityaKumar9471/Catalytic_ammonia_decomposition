Introduction

Ammonia decomposition is a critical process in various industrial applications. Understanding and predicting the rate of ammonia decomposition based on catalyst features and reaction conditions can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes. This project employs machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

Data Preprocessing

Basic preprocessing steps were carried out to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This included handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

Data Visualization

Data visualization techniques were employed to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between different variables. Various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots were used.

Correlation Analysis

Mathematical correlation between catalyst features, reaction conditions, and ammonia decomposition was analyzed using indicators such as Pearson correlation coefficients. This step helped identify the most influential features.

Catalytic Features Study

A detailed study was conducted on catalytic features to understand their impact on ammonia conversion. This involved analyzing the properties of catalysts and how they interact with reaction conditions.

Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models were used to predict ammonia decomposition:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Model Evaluation

The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

RÂ² Score
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Comparisons were made to identify the best-performing model for predicting ammonia decomposition.

Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrated the application of various machine learning models in predicting ammonia decomposition. The analysis revealed significant insights into the impact of catalyst features and reaction conditions on the decomposition rate.
